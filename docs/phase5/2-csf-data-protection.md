# Topic 2: Data Protection and Secrets Management

Data is the most valuable asset in your cloud environment. Before you secure your Journal API's data, you need to understand encryption, key management, and secrets management fundamentals.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you will understand:

- Encryption at rest vs encryption in transit
- Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
- Key management best practices
- Secrets management and why it matters
- Data classification and sensitivity levels
- Common data security mistakes and how to avoid them

## Core Learning Resources

### 1. Read: Encryption Fundamentals
Start with these foundational resources:

- [Encryption at Rest vs In Transit](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption) - Google Cloud guide
- [AWS Key Management Service Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html)
- [Azure Key Vault Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview)

### 2. Watch: Data Protection in the Cloud
- [Encryption in the Cloud Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plv7EnY5QSo) (20 minutes)
- [AWS KMS Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z0wsE2HoSo) (45 minutes)
- [Secrets Management Best Practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK1h7Leh_yI) (30 minutes)

### 3. Learn: Data Security Best Practices
- [OWASP Top 10 for APIs](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/) - Focus on data exposure issues
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework - Protect](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/protect)

## Key Concepts to Master

### Encryption Types

**Encryption at Rest**:
- Protects data stored in databases, file systems, or object storage
- Uses symmetric encryption (same key for encrypt/decrypt)
- Managed by cloud providers automatically in most cases

**Encryption in Transit**:
- Protects data moving between systems (API calls, database connections)
- Uses TLS/SSL protocols
- Essential for any web application

### Key Management

**Customer-Managed Keys vs Provider-Managed Keys**:
- **Provider-managed**: Cloud provider handles all key operations (easier)
- **Customer-managed**: You control key rotation, access policies (more control)

**Key Rotation**:
- Regularly changing encryption keys to limit exposure
- Can be automated by cloud key management services
- Critical for long-term security

### Secrets Management

**What Are Secrets**:
- Database passwords
- API keys
- Certificates
- OAuth tokens
- Any sensitive configuration data

**Why Secrets Management Matters**:
- Prevents hardcoding credentials in code
- Enables automatic rotation
- Provides audit trails of secret access
- Centralizes sensitive configuration

### Data Classification

**Public**: No risk if disclosed (marketing materials)
**Internal**: Low risk if disclosed (internal documentation)
**Confidential**: Moderate risk if disclosed (customer data)
**Restricted**: High risk if disclosed (payment information, personal data)

## Test Your Knowledge

Use an AI assistant to test your understanding. Here are example prompts:

1. "Quiz me on the difference between encryption at rest and encryption in transit"
2. "Ask me to explain symmetric vs asymmetric encryption with examples"
3. "Test my knowledge of when to use customer-managed vs provider-managed keys"
4. "Quiz me on secrets management best practices"
5. "Ask me about data classification levels and how to apply them"
6. "Test my understanding of key rotation and why it's important"
7. "Quiz me on common data security mistakes in cloud applications"
8. "Ask me about the difference between hashing and encryption"
