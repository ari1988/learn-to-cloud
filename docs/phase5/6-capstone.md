# Topic 6: Secure Your Journal API - Capstone

Now it's time to implement everything you've learned! This capstone project will transform your Journal API from a basic application into a production-ready, enterprise-grade secure system. You'll apply all the concepts from Topics 1-5 in a cohesive, real-world implementation.

## Project Overview

You'll implement comprehensive security for your Journal API by building five layers of protection:

1. **IAM Security**: Identity and access controls (Topic 1)
2. **Data Protection**: Encryption and secrets management (Topic 2)  
3. **Network Security**: Secure connectivity and isolation (Topic 3)
4. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time detection and alerting (Topic 4)
5. **Incident Response**: Automated threat response (Topic 5)

**Don't have the Journal API?** Use any web application you have (Flask app, Node.js app, WordPress, or even a static site). The security principles apply to any cloud application.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this capstone, your application will have:

- **Zero hardcoded secrets** - All credentials managed securely
- **Encrypted everything** - Data protected at rest and in transit
- **Network isolation** - Application components properly segmented
- **Real-time monitoring** - Security events detected within minutes
- **Automated responses** - Common threats handled automatically
- **Complete audit trail** - Every action logged and trackable
- **Incident playbooks** - Clear procedures for security events

This represents the security standard expected in production environments.

## Pre-Implementation Setup

Before you start, ensure you have:

1. **Your application running** - Journal API deployed and accessible
2. **Administrative access** - Full permissions in your cloud account
3. **Cost monitoring** - Set up billing alerts (target: under $50/month)
4. **Documentation template** - Create folders for your security documentation

## Part 1: Foundation Security (IAM & Network)

### 1.1: Implement Identity and Access Management

**Create your IAM strategy:**
- Design a service account for your Journal API application
- Create IAM roles following least privilege principle
- Set up MFA for your administrative account
- Create an access matrix documenting who can access what

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Journal API service account created with minimal permissions
- [ ] Database access role separate from API role  
- [ ] Monitoring service account for security tools
- [ ] Administrative access requires MFA
- [ ] All access documented in IAM matrix

**Test your IAM:**
- Try accessing resources with the wrong service account (should fail)
- Verify your application works with the new restricted permissions
- Test MFA requirement for administrative access

### 1.2: Secure Your Network Architecture

**Design your network security:**
- Create VPC with public and private subnets
- Place your API in private subnet, load balancer in public
- Configure security groups with minimum required access
- Set up private endpoints for database connections

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] VPC created with proper CIDR blocks
- [ ] Public subnet for load balancer only
- [ ] Private subnet for application and database
- [ ] Security groups allow only necessary ports
- [ ] Database accessible only from application subnet
- [ ] Internet access through NAT Gateway (if needed)

**Test your network:**
- Verify your API is not directly accessible from internet
- Confirm database cannot be reached from public subnet
- Test that your application can still function properly

## Part 2: Data Protection & Monitoring

### 2.1: Implement Data Protection

**Secure your data:**
- Enable encryption at rest for database and file storage
- Configure TLS/SSL for all API communications
- Move all secrets to a secrets management service
- Set up automated encrypted backups

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Database encryption enabled
- [ ] File storage encryption enabled
- [ ] TLS certificate configured (use Let's Encrypt or cloud provider)
- [ ] API keys moved to secrets manager
- [ ] Database passwords in secrets manager
- [ ] Automated daily backups configured
- [ ] Backup encryption verified

**Test your data protection:**
- Verify HTTPS is working (check certificate in browser)
- Confirm secrets are no longer in code or config files
- Test application works with secrets from secrets manager
- Attempt to access backups and verify they're encrypted

### 2.2: Deploy Security Monitoring

**Set up your monitoring stack:**
- Configure audit logging for all services
- Deploy security monitoring dashboard
- Create alerts for suspicious activities
- Set up log aggregation and analysis

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] CloudTrail/audit logging enabled for all services
- [ ] Security dashboard deployed (CloudWatch, Grafana, etc.)
- [ ] Failed login attempt alerts configured
- [ ] Unusual API access pattern alerts set up
- [ ] Database access monitoring enabled
- [ ] Network security group change alerts
- [ ] Resource modification notifications

**Test your monitoring:**
- Generate a failed login attempt (confirm alert fires)
- Make an unusual API call pattern (verify detection)
- Modify a security group (check notification received)
- Review logs to ensure all activities are captured

## Part 3: Advanced Security & Response

### 3.1: Implement Threat Detection

**Build automated threat detection:**
- Deploy cloud security service (GuardDuty, Security Center, etc.)
- Configure behavioral analysis for your application
- Set up threat intelligence feeds
- Create threat detection rules specific to your application

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Cloud threat detection service enabled
- [ ] Behavioral baselines established for normal API usage
- [ ] Threat intelligence integration configured
- [ ] Custom detection rules for your application patterns
- [ ] Integration with your monitoring dashboard

### 3.2: Create Incident Response System

**Build automated response capabilities:**
- Create incident response workflows
- Implement automated remediation for common threats
- Build runbooks for manual response procedures
- Set up incident communication channels

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Automated response to compromised credentials
- [ ] Automatic isolation of suspicious network activity
- [ ] Incident escalation workflows defined
- [ ] Runbooks created for each incident type
- [ ] Communication plan for security incidents
- [ ] Regular testing schedule for incident procedures

## Part 4: Validation & Documentation

### 4.1: Security Testing

**Test all your security controls:**

**Authentication Testing:**
- Attempt API access without proper credentials
- Try to access admin functions without authorization
- Test MFA bypass attempts

**Network Security Testing:**
- Attempt direct database connections from internet
- Try to access application servers directly
- Test security group rule enforcement

**Data Protection Testing:**
- Verify encryption at rest is working
- Confirm TLS/SSL is properly configured
- Test secrets management integration

**Monitoring Testing:**
- Generate security events and verify alerts
- Test incident response automation
- Validate log collection and analysis

### 4.2: Create Security Documentation

**Document your complete security implementation:**

**Architecture Documentation:**

- Network topology with security zones marked
- Data flow diagrams showing encryption points
- IAM structure and access paths

**Operational Documentation:**
- Incident response runbooks for each threat type
