# Topic 10: Cloud Security Fundamentals Capstone

Demonstrate your cloud security knowledge by implementing a comprehensive security monitoring and incident response system. You'll add enterprise-grade security to the infrastructure you've built throughout this course, securing the Journal API application that has evolved from Phase 2 through Phase 4.

## Capstone Steps

**Note**: If you haven't completed previous phases, you can deploy any simple web application (e.g., a basic Flask/Express app, WordPress, or even a static website) as your target infrastructure to secure.

### 1. **Secure the Infrastructure**
Take your existing cloud infrastructure (from Phase 3's deployment or Phase 4's containerized/Kubernetes setup) and add the following security controls:
- Configure IAM roles following least privilege principle
- Implement network segmentation with proper security groups/NACLs
- Enable encryption for all data at rest (databases, object storage)
- Set up secure secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager)
- Configure secure logging (CloudTrail/Azure Activity Log/GCP Cloud Logging)

### 2. **Implement Security Monitoring**
Set up comprehensive security monitoring:
- Deploy a SIEM solution (AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel, or GCP Security Command Center)
- Configure security alerts for:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Unauthorized API calls
  - Security group modifications
  - Public resource exposure
  - Anomalous user behavior
- Create a security dashboard showing:
  - Current security posture score
  - Active threats/alerts
  - Compliance status
  - Resource inventory

### 3. **Build Automated Incident Response**
Create automated responses to common security events:
- **Exposed S3 Bucket/Storage**: Automatically make private and notify team
- **Suspicious IAM Activity**: Disable user/key and create incident ticket
- **DDoS Detection**: Enable rate limiting and scale resources
- **Compromised Instance**: Isolate instance, snapshot for forensics, terminate

Example automation structure:
```
Event Detection → Lambda/Function/Cloud Function → Response Action → Notification
```

### 4. **Demonstrate and Document**
Create a demonstration showing:
- Trigger each security event intentionally
- Show automated response in action
- Display alerts and notifications
- Generate incident report
- Document lessons learned and improvements

Include in your documentation:
- Architecture diagram with security controls
- Runbook for each incident type
- Cost analysis of security implementation
- Recommendations for future improvements

    /incident-response # Lambda functions for automated responses
  /monitoring          # Security monitoring configs
    /alerts            # Alert definitions
    /dashboards        # Grafana/CloudWatch dashboards
  /docs                # Documentation
    /runbooks          # Incident response runbooks
    /architecture      # Security architecture diagrams
  /terraform           # IaC for security resources
  README.md
```

## Testing & Validation

- Intentionally expose an S3 bucket publicly—verify it's automatically secured within minutes
- Attempt unauthorized API calls—confirm alerts are generated and logged
- Modify a security group to allow all traffic—verify automated remediation
- Generate failed login attempts—check SIEM dashboard shows the activity
- Run a security scan against your infrastructure—verify all controls are in place
- Review CloudTrail/audit logs to ensure all actions are being logged

---

## Success Criteria
- All infrastructure follows security best practices
- Monitoring detects and alerts on security events within 5 minutes
- Automated responses execute without manual intervention
- Clear documentation allows others to replicate your setup
- Total monthly cost stays under $50 (use free tiers where possible)
