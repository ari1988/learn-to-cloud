# Welcome

Learn to Cloud (L2C) is a courseware built on the belief that anyone can learn foundational cloud engineering skills with the right guide and discipline.

This guide is focused on helping you learn the skillset of a junior cloud engineer, not ANY other role.

## üíª Why should I use it?

Our platform is intentionally:

- **designed to guide, not handhold**

    We provide essential details while leaving intentional gaps to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-sufficiency.

- **focused on practice with purpose**

    We balance hands-on learning with carefully integrated theory to promote intentional learning rather than passive progression.

- **constantly evolving**

    Built and updated by professionals who actively work in the field. Expect updates that keep it relevant and aligned with industry standards.

## ü§ë Cost?

No cost, no account needed, nothing. You have no excuses. L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.

## ‚åöÔ∏è Time?

Self paced. However, you could realistically cover eveything in 6 months with about 2 hours per day and more on weekends.

## Prerequisites

- [Subscribe for free Cloud tutorials and Career advice, tips, and resources](http://youtube.com/madebygps).
- Join the [Learn to Cloud Discord](https://discord.gg/Qymw28nQX6) and introduce yourself in the #intros-and-socials channel.

## üí™üèΩ What do you need to know before starting?

The only requirements are motivation and discipline - these are aspects we cannot provide for you.

Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.

Good luck on your journey!
