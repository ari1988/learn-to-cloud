# Topic 2: Cloud CLI setup

Now we're going to setup your cloud environment. Make sure you've created an account with any of our supported clouds: AWS, Azure, or GCP.

1. Create an account with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free)

2. Once you have an account, you need to get familiar with the cloud console of your selected cloud provider. Getting Started with the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/getting-started-with-aws-management-console/) or [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview)
3. You should be a little familiar with your cloud console now. You can of course deploy things by clicking but we would rather you use the CLI. Study: [Why use a CLI](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/).
4. Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [GCP CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
