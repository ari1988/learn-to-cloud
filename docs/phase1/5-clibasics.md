# Topic 5: Linux CLI Basics

You need to have Linux CLI skills to work with cloud. We recommend you read [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers#content). You could also go through the list of commands below and research them individually, though we recommend the book.

## Foundational Commands

Before starting the challenges, familiarize yourself with these essential commands:

- `pwd`: Print working directory – shows your current location.
- `cd`: Change directory – navigate between folders.
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `cat`: Display file contents.

## Challenge 1: Hidden Files

Learn these commands to find hidden files:

- `ls -a`: List all files, including hidden ones.
- `ls -la`: Detailed listing including hidden files.
- `find . -name ".*"`: Search for hidden files.

**Key concepts:**

- In Linux, hidden files start with a dot (`.`).
- Hidden files are not shown by default.
- Use the `-a` flag with `ls` to show hidden files.

## Challenge 2: File Searching

Master these file search commands:

- `find /path -name "pattern"`: Search for files by name.
- `find /path -type f`: Search for regular files.
- `locate filename`: Quick file search using a database.
- `grep -r "text" /path`: Recursively search file contents.

## Challenge 3: File Size Analysis

Commands for analyzing file sizes:

- `ls -lh`: List files with human-readable sizes.
- `du -h`: Display disk usage.
- `sort -h`: Sort by human-readable sizes.
- `find /path -type f -size +1M`: Find files larger than 1MB.

## Challenge 4: User Investigation

Commands for user management:

- `id username`: Display user ID and groups.
- `cat /etc/passwd`: View user accounts.
- `getent passwd uid`: Get user by UID.
- `ls -l /home/`: List home directories.

**Understanding user files:**

- `/etc/passwd`: User account information.
- `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc`: Shell configuration files.

## Challenge 5: Permission Analysis

Commands for working with permissions:

- `ls -l`: View file permissions.
- `stat filename`: Detailed file information.
- `find / -perm 777`: Find files with specific permissions.
- `chmod`: Change file permissions.

## Challenge 6: Network Services

Network investigation commands:

- `netstat -tuln`: List listening ports.
- `ss -tuln`: Modern alternative to netstat.
- `lsof -i`: List open network files.
- `curl localhost:port`: Test HTTP service connectivity.
- `nc -zv host port`: Test TCP connection.

## Challenge 7: Encoding/Decoding

Text processing commands:

- `base64`: Encode or decode text.
- `echo -n "text"`: Echo without a newline.
- The pipe operator (`|`) for chaining commands.

## Challenge 8: SSH Configuration

SSH-related commands and best practices:

- `ls -la ~/.ssh/`: List SSH directory contents.
- `find ~/.ssh -type f`: Find SSH-related files.
- `chmod 600`: Set secure file permissions for keys.
- `ssh-keygen`: Generate SSH keys.

**Best practices:**

- Keep your private keys secure.
- Ensure correct file permissions (e.g., 600 for keys).
- Review your `authorized_keys` file.

## Challenge 9: DNS Troubleshooting

Now that the challenges include DNS configuration issues, learn to compare and edit configuration files:

- Familiarize yourself with `/etc/resolv.conf` and its backup.
- Practice using file comparison tools to spot differences.
- Review editing commands to modify files safely.

## Challenge 10: Remote Upload

In this challenge, you'll trigger a flag by uploading a file:

- Understand common methods to transfer files (such as using secure copy or similar utilities).
- Learn how to work with remote directories to detect new files.
- Experiment with different file transfer approaches.

## Challenge 11: Web Configuration

This challenge involves identifying a web server's non-standard port:

- Learn how to locate and review configuration files (for example, those for `nginx`).
- Familiarize yourself with the basics of service management to restart or reload services.
- Understand how configuration settings affect the behavior of web servers.

## Challenge 12: Network Traffic Analysis

In the latest challenge, you will analyze network traffic to discover hidden messages:

- Get familiar with network traffic capture methods.
- Learn to inspect packet contents for hidden data.
- Experiment with network analysis tools without relying on exact command recipes.

## General Tips

1. Use `man` pages to understand command options.
2. Experiment with various command combinations and piping techniques.
3. Work through each challenge to build your understanding incrementally.

Remember: The goal is to learn the commands and understand how they work. Take time to experiment with each command and explore its options and behaviors.
