# Linux Command Line CTF Challenge

Welcome, CTF participants! This guide will walk you through the seven challenges you'll face in this Linux Command Line Capture The Flag. Each challenge is designed to test a different aspect of your Linux skills.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

As you complete each challenge, we encourage you to take note of any concepts or commands you find challenging and to revisit them later for further study. Additionally, we kindly ask that you **DO NOT SHARE SOLUTIONS** in social media posts. We aim to discourage copying and pasting and request your support in this effort. Instead, share your reflections and unique perspectives along with the announcement that youâ€™ve completed the labs.

## How to access

This CTF challenge requires you to deploy a lab environment from your local machine to your preferred cloud provider, everything is automated via files we provide. We opted for this instead of hosted labs because it will give you the closest to real world experience.

Start by going to the [repo](https://github.com/learntocloud/ltc-linux-challenge).
