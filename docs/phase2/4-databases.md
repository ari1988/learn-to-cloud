# Topic 4: Databases

We will be using a database to store our application data. For this we need to first understand how databases work and how to interact with them. Let's start with the basics.

- Study: [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)

Then, decide which cloud you will use. For AWS, you will use DynamoDB, and for Azure, you will use Cosmos DB.

- Study: [AWS DynamoDB Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k2GINpO308)

- Study: [Azure Cosmos DB Essentials Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLasX02E8BPDd2fKwLCHnmWoyo4bL-oKr&feature=shared/)

Then do the Python quickstart for the database you chose.

- Action: [AWS DynamoDB Python Quickstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/example_dynamodb_Scenario_GettingStartedMovies_section.html)

- Action: [Azure Cosmos DB Python Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-python)

## Test your knowledge

Once you are done with the tutorials, test your knowledge with an AI assistant. Here are some example prompts to test your database knowledge:

1. Can you ask me to explain what a database is and how it works?
2. Can you quiz me on the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
3. Can you ask me to explain the concept of CRUD operations in databases?
4. Can you ask me to explain how to connect to a database from a Python application?
5. Can you quiz me on how to perform CRUD operations in a database using Python?
6. Can you ask me to explain how to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library in Python?
7. Can you ask me to explain how to use a NoSQL database like DynamoDB or Cosmos DB?
8. Can you quiz me on how to model data in a NoSQL database like DynamoDB or Cosmos DB?
