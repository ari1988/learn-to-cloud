# Topic 5: Capstone Project

Now that you've got some Python skills under your belt, we've got an old codebase that needs some love! This Journal API project will test everything you've learned so far, and you'll be deploying it to the cloud in the next phase. Consider this your graduation project from the Python basics - time to put those skills to work!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the [starter repo](https://github.com/learntocloud/journal-starter)
2. All the instructions are in the README.md file

## Next Steps

Complete this capstone before moving to cloud deployment in the next phase. 
Make sure all API endpoints are working locally before proceeding. You will
use this same repository for the cloud deployment phase so DO NOT SKIP.
