# Topic 2: Rest API

In the previous topic, the recommended book introduced you to Django, so you should have some context and knowledge about how REST APIs work. In this step we want to further improve your knowledge on REST APIs.

1. Study: [What Is REST API?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mN3VyJuCjM/) by Byte Byte Go
1. Study: [REST API Concepts and Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA) by WebConcepts
1. Watch [RESTful APIs in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/-MTSQjw5DrM?feature=shared)

## Test your knowledge

Once you are done with the videos, test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your REST API knowledge:

1. Can you ask me to explain what REST stands for and how it works?
2. Can you quiz me on the difference between a REST API and a SOAP API?
3. Can you ask me to explain the concept of resources in REST?
4. Can you ask me to explain the difference between PUT and POST requests in REST?
5. Can you quiz me on how to use the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE in REST?
6. Can you ask me to explain the concept of status codes in REST and give examples?
