# Phase 2: Programming

Last Updated: April 2025

Welcome to Phase 2, this one is all about programming, specifically with Python. 

Programming is a fundamental skill for cloud engineering, enabling you to create, manage, and optimize cloud resources efficiently. 

You don't need to know how to build UIs but you need to know how to work with APIs and other cloud services like storage, databases, etc. Knowing how to program will make you more competitive in the hiring market.

As learners finish this phase, many will share their code. We recommend you do not copy and paste anybody's solution. You are only doing a disservice to yourself and will not make it in this field if that is the mentality you have.

Additionally, we recommend you turn off any AI assistants you might have for code completion, though using AI to ask for explanations and clarification is highly recommended. We will continue to suggest prompts throughout the guide.

## Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will have:

- Learned the basics of programming and Python
- Learned the basics of how  REST APIs work
- Learned the basics of FastAPI
- Learned how to use cloud SDKs to interact with cloud services via code
- Completed the Capstone project

## Prerequisites

- Mac OS or a Ubuntu based computer. If you're on Windows, you'll use WSL.
