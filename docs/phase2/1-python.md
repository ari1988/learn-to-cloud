# Topic 1: Python Basics

Python is a very popular programming language with many uses in cloud engineering and a great community, which is why we've selected it as the language to learn in this guide.

Go through [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) by Eric Matthes. The entire book, take it a chapter a day and you should be able to get it done in a month with a couple of hours of study per day.

This book is a great resource for beginners to learn Python programming. It covers the basics of Python syntax, data structures, functions, and modules. The book also includes hands-on projects to help you practice your skills and build real-world applications.

## Test your knowledge

Once you are done with the book, watch the [CS50 lecture on Python](https://youtu.be/LfaMVlDaQ24?feature=shared&t=49364). Everything here should make sense to you, if not, you are not ready to move on.

Test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your Python knowledge:

1. Can you ask me about the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
2. Can you quiz me on how to create a dictionary in Python?
3. Can you ask me to explain the concept of list comprehensions with an example?
4. Can you ask me what a lambda function is and how it is used?
5. Can you quiz me on how to handle exceptions in Python?
6. Can you ask me about Python decorators and how they work?
7. Can you ask me to explain the difference between `__init__` and `__new__` methods in Python classes?
8. Can you quiz me on how to read and write files in Python?
