# Topic 2: Continous Deployment and Continous Integration

One challenge youâ€™ll face after the previous phase is the need to manually run the rebuild and push commands for every change made to your code, which can become a tedious and error-prone process. In this topic, we will explain how to automate this entire process using Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. These pipelines allow you to automatically build, test, and deploy your application every time changes are made, ensuring a smooth and reliable development workflow.

There are various CI/CD tools available, such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI, which streamline this process by automatically executing tasks and deploying code based on triggers like code commits, pull requests, or scheduled events.

## Test your knowledge

Test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your knowledge of Virtualization and Compute Services:
1. What is the difference between Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continous Deployment?
2. What are the components of a typical CI/CD pipeline?
3. Describe the role of version control in a CI/CD pipeline.
4. How does Continuous Deployment differ from Continuous Delivery, and when would you use one over the other?


## Hands-on Tasks
Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for your containerized application from the previous phase, using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automatically rebuild and push your Docker container to a container registry (e.g., DockerHub, AWS ECR, GCP GCR).
