# Topic 1: Containerization

Containerization is a modern approach to deploying and managing applications and services across various environments. It allows you to package software, tools, and their dependencies into lightweight, portable units called Containers. 

There are lots of Containerisation tools available like Docker, Podman, Containerd etc.
In this topic, you’ll learn how to use tools like Docker to create these isolated environments and explore how cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP support containerized workloads.

## Test your knowledge

Test your knowledge with an AI assistant, here are some example prompts to test your knowledge of Containerization:

1. What is containerization and how does it differ from virtualization?
2. Describe the structure of a Dockerfile and its role in containerization.
3. What is a container registry and how is it used in deploying applications?
4. What is the difference between DockerHub and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)?
5. Walk through the steps of containerizing a Node.js (or your app’s stack) application.
6. What command would you use to build, tag, and push a Docker image to DockerHub?
7. How do containerized environments improve team collaboration and deployment workflows?


## Hands-on Tasks
Containerize any of your application and push it to a container registry
